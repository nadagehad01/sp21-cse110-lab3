                <h2>April 8th</h2>
                    <p>
                    On april 8th, I got new ear piercings! I went with 2 of my friends/neighbors. Their names are Nour and Menna. We were arguing about who will get pierced first because we were all lowkey scared of getting pierced with a needle. Anyway... here's the order of who got pierced first:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Nour</li>
                        <li>Menna</li>
                        <li>Nada (me)</li>
                    </ol>

                <h2>April 10th</h2>
                <p>
                    On April 10th, I visited my best friend's house, surprised her for her birthday, and then we decided to put up some Ramadan (a muslim holy month in the year) decorations!
                    Here is what the typical ramadan kind of print typically look like in Egypt: <br> <br>
                    <img src="ramadan.jpg" alt="ramadan decorations" width=200> <br><br>
                    As you can see, there's a lot of <span style="color:red">red</span> and some <span style="color:blue">blue</span>.
                    <br> <br>
                    Here is also music that we correlate with ramadan. <br><br>
                    <audio controls>
                        <source src="ramad.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
                    </audio>

                <h2>April 11th</h2>
                <p>
                    On April 11th, I started doing this lab because I procrastinated it. :/ Here is me learning the difference between <b>b</b>, <strong>strong</strong>, <i>i</i>, and <em>em</em>. This day is also the last night before Ramadan, and usually our sleeping schedules get flipped in ramadan, so we stayed up until 4 AM just to warm up for the month LOL.

                <h2>April 12th</h2>
                <p>
                    That day my friend (whose birthday was that day) and I went to eat brunch with a really nice view! That was the last day before we start fasting for the following month, so that was our last breakfast for quite a while. That's because in Ramadan, Muslims don't eat between ~4 AM and 6 PM (not even water :p). 
                    Here is a glimpse from our breakfast and view:
